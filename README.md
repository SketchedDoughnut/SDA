# Welcome to SDA!

SDA, the Sketched Doughnut Distraction Act, is a project I have been working on which includes a game collection. As development continues, I have more plans to try and expand what I do with this. <br>
For inquiries, please email: **(TBD)** <br>

# How to install

**NOTE**: This code has been optimised and built for Windows 10, and python 3.11. There is currently no support for other operating systems.
Additionally, the installer in this repository and the source code repository does not have a code-signing certificate. Install at your own will.

To install, go to 
[releases](https://github.com/SketchedDoughnut/SDA/releases/latest) 
and install the latest release, "source_code.zip". Extract the files, then run "fiesta-modern.exe". It will run you through the steps to install, and then you're done!
Please note that the installer currently also doubles as the deletion agent, so if you want it for that purpose, then please do not delete it.
