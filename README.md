# Welcome to SDA!

SDA, the Sketched Doughnut Distraction Act, is a project I have been working on which includes a game collection. As development continues, I have more plans to try and expand what I do with this. <br>
For inquiries, please email: **(TBD)** <br>
Sources / Credits are in: **(install_location)/game_name/everything/credits/**

# How to set up 

To install, go to releases and install the latest release. Extract the files, then run "fiesta-modern.exe". It will run you through the steps. 

# FAQ

**What do I do if I notice a bug, or some sort of issue?** <br>
You can come to this repository, go to Issues, and create a new one! I will try to get back to you when I can.

**Can I help work with you on this?** <br>
Currently, this has been a project I have kept to myself. In the future, I might include others in development. However, if you want to suggest ideas, feel free to! A form will be displayed below once I stop procrastinating making it.
